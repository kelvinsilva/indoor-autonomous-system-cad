## Indoor Autonomous Navigation System Chassis

This repository contains the design for an indoor autonomous navigation system; specifically a small two wheeled robot equipped with LIDAR and several other sensors. Using a mobile phone control panel, users are able to direct the robot around a predetermined map. Screenshots of the design and videos of it in action will be released soon.
